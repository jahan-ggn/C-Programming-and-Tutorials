In Array we can store data of one type only, but structure is a variable that gives facility of 
storing data of different data type in one variable.<br/><br/>

Structures are variables that have several parts; each part of the object can have different types.<br/> 
Each part of the structure is called a member of the structure.<br/><br/>

<b><font color="#40C4FF"># Declaration</font></b><br/><br/>

Consider basic data of student :<br/>roll_no, class, name, age, address.<br/><br/>
A structure data type called student can hold all this information:<br/>
struct student {<br/>
	int roll_no<br/>
	char class<br/>
	char name[25];<br/>
	int age;<br/>
	char address[50];<br/>
};<br/><br/>

before the final semicolon, At the end of the structure's definition, we can specify one or more structure variables.<br/><br/>  
There is also another way of declaring variables given below,<br/>
struct student s1;<br/><br/>

<b><font color="#40C4FF"># Initialization</font></b><br/><br/>
Structure members can be initialized at declaration. This is same as the initialization of arrays; 
the values are listed inside braces. The structure declaration is preceded by the keyword static.<br/><br/>
static struct student akki ={1234,''comp'',''akki'',20,''mumbai''};<br/><br/>

<b><font color="#40C4FF"># Accessing structure data</font></b><br/><br/>
To access a given member the dot notation is use. The ''dot'' is called the member access operator<br/><br/>
struct student s1;<br/>
s1.name = ''Akki'';<br/>
s1.roll_no = 1234<br/><br/>

<b><font color="#40C4FF"># scope</font></b><br/><br/>
A structure type declaration can be local or global, depending upon where the declaration is made.
