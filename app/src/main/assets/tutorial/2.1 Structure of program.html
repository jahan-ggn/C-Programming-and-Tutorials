1 . /* This program ... */<br/><br/> 
The symbols/* and*/ used for comment. 
This Comments are ignored by the compiler, and are used to provide useful information about program to humans who use it.<br/><br/>

2. #include&lt;stdio.h><br/><br/>
This is a preprocessor command which tells compiler to include stdio.h file.<br/><br/>

3. main()<br/><br/> 
C programs consist of one or more functions. There must be one and only one function called main. The brackets following the word main indicate that it is a function and not a variable.<br/><br/>

4. { }<br/><br/> 
braces surround the body of the function, which may have one or more instructions/statements.<br/><br/>

5. printf()<br/><br/> 
it is a library function that is used to print data on the user screen.<br/><br/>

6. ''Hello World\n'' is a string that will be displayed on user screen <br/>
\n is the newline character.<br/>
; a semicolon ends a statement.<br/><br/>

7. return 0; return the value zero to the Operating system.<br/><br/><br/>

C is case sensitive language, so the names of the functions must be typed in lower case as above.<br/><br/> 
we can use white spaces, tabs & new line characters to make our code easy to read.
