We can jump to any statement inside the same function using <b>goto</b>. 
To spot the end point of the jump a label (tag) is used. goto statement is not to ideal to choose in any programming language because it makes difficult to trace the flow of a program, makes the program hard to understand, and to guess the output.<br/><br/>

void any_function(void)<br/>
{<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp for( ... )<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp if (problem) goto error;<br/><br/>
error:<br/>solve problem<br/>
}<br/><br/>

But in the example above, remember that the code could be rewritten as:<br/><br/>
void function1(void)<br/>
{<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp for( ... )<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp if (problem)<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp {<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp solve problem<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp return;<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp }<br/>
}
