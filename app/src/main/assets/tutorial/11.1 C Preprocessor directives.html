Before a C program is compiled in a compiler, source code is processed by a program called preprocessor. 
This process is called preprocessing.<br/><br/>

Commands used in preprocessor are called preprocessor directives and they begin with ''#'' symbol. 
Below is the list of preprocessor directives that C language offers.<br/><br/>

<b>1 Macro</b><br/>
syntax:<br/>
#define <br/>
This macro defines constant value and can be any of the basic data types.<br/><br/>

<b>2 Header file inclusion 	</b><br/>
syntax:<br/>
#include &lt;file_name><br/> 	
The source code of the file ''file_name'' is included in the main program at the specified place<br/><br/>

<b>3 Conditional compilation</b><br/>
syntax:<br/>
#ifdef, #endif, #if, #else,  #ifndef<br/>
Set of commands are included or excluded in source program before compilation with respect to the condition<br/><br/>

<b>4 Other directives</b> 	<br/>
syntax:<br/>
#undef, #pragma<br/> 	
#undef is used to undefine a defined macro variable.<br/> 
#Pragma is used to call a function before and after main function in a C program<br/>
